#' @description
#' \Sexpr[results=rd, stage=render]{ lifecycle::badge("experimental") }
#'
#' This function calculates the taxonomic diversity, taxonomic distinctness and variation of taxonomic distinctness.
#'
#'
#' @param x Result of `aggregate_taxa()`.
#' @param complete If `TRUE` unassigned taxon are removed from the taxonomic list of the desired taxonomic level set with `tax_lev`.
#' @param tax_lev Taxonomic level from which the indices have to be calculated.
#' @param method Available methods are delta (taxonomic diversity), delta.st (taxonomic distinctness) and delta.bin (variation in taxonomic distinctness).
#' @param taxa_tree If `TRUE` `dness()` return a list where the first element is the taxonomic diversity, taxonomic distinctness or variation of taxonomic distinctness and the second elemnt the taxonomic tree
#'
#' @details These indeces take into account the taxonomic relatedness of the species in each sample. According to Clarke and Warwick (1998, 2001),
#' taxonomic diversity is the average taxonomic ‘distance’ between any two organisms chosen at random from the sample,
#' taxonomic distinctness is the average path length between any two randomly chosen individuals conditional on them being from different species and
#' variation in taxonomic distinctness is the variance of the path length through the taxonomic tree connecting every pair of species in the list and
#' reflects the unevenness of the taxonomic tree.
