#' combine_taxa
#'
#' This function returns all the combinations of n taxa at the desired taxonomic resolution.
#' @param x Result of `aggregate_taxa()`.
#' @param ntaxa Number of taxa.
#' @param tax_lev Taxonomic level on which the calculation has to be made.
#' @details This function is intended to help the user to identify the best subset of taxa that correlates with environmental variables.
#' Metrics based on a specific group of taxa (EPT, 1-GOLD, etc) are currently used in biomonitoring. They rely on available information on the responses
#' of the selected taxa to target stressors. The relationship between an environmental variable and a subset of taxa could exist and not detected due to the scarce
#' availaibility of autoecological data. With more than 4 taxa the calculations should become infeasible, expecially when the number
#' of taxa in the user dataset is high.
