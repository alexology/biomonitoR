#' @title Methods to deal with ambiguous taxa
#'
#' @description
#' Solve the ambiguous assignment of taxa.
#'
#' @param x Result of `aggregate_taxa()`.
#' @param method Only methods `RPKC` and `MCWP` are currently implemented in `biomonitoR`. See details.
#'
#' @details Taxonomic dataset often contains ambiguous taxa due to the difficulites in identify damaged and juvenile organisms.
#' For instance Chironominae and Chironomidae could be reported in the same sample. Several techniques has been
#' proposed to solve this issue (see Cuffney et al., 2007).
#' Currently `solve_ambiguous()` provides two algorithms to solve the problem of ambiguous assignments.
#' `RPKC` means Remove Parents - Keep Children. It works by removing all the higher taxonomic levels while keeping children.
#' `MCWP` means Merge Children with Parents. It works by assignign the abundances of lower taxonomic levels to those of the higher taxonomic level.
