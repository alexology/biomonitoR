#' get_taxa_richness
#'
#' @description
#'
#' This function calculates the absolute richness of a taxon or of a set taxa at the taxonomic level provided by the user.
#'
#'
#' @param x Result of `aggregate_taxa()`.
#' @param taxa A taxon or a vector of taxa.
#' @param tax_lev Taxonomic level at which richness has to be calculated. It could be also a vector of taxonomic levels.
