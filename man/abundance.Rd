\usage{
abundance(x, tax_lev = "Taxa", unassigned = FALSE)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Result of \code{aggregate_taxa()}.}

\item{tax_lev}{Taxonomic level at which the calculation has to be performed.}

\item{unassigned}{Does unassigned taxa need to be taken into account? If yes set unassigned to \code{TRUE}, otherwise \code{FALSE}.}
}
\description{
Calculates taxa abundance at the desired taxonomic level.
Unassigned taxa can be included or excluded from the calculation.
}
\details{
If unassigned is set to \code{TRUE} abundances are equal among taxonomic levels.
}
\examples{
data(macro_ex)
data_bio <- as_biomonitor(macro_ex)
data_agr <- aggregate_taxa(data_bio)
abundance(data_agr, tax_lev = "Family")
