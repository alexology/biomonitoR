\usage{
dness(
  x,
  complete = FALSE,
  tax_lev = "Genus",
  method = "delta",
  taxa_tree = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{Result of \code{aggregate_taxa()}.}

\item{complete}{If \code{TRUE} unassigned taxon are removed from the taxonomic list of the desired taxonomic level set with \code{tax_lev}.}

\item{tax_lev}{Taxonomic level from which the indices have to be calculated.}

\item{method}{Available methods are delta (taxonomic diversity), delta.st (taxonomic distinctness) and delta.bin (variation in taxonomic distinctness).}

\item{taxa_tree}{If \code{TRUE} \code{dness()} return a list where the first element is the taxonomic diversity, taxonomic distinctness or variation of taxonomic distinctness and the second elemnt the taxonomic tree}

\description{
\Sexpr[results=rd, stage=render]{ lifecycle::badge("experimental") }

This function calculates the taxonomic diversity, taxonomic distinctness and variation of taxonomic distinctness.
}
\details{
These indeces take into account the taxonomic relatedness of the species in each sample. According to Clarke and Warwick (1998, 2001),
taxonomic diversity is the average taxonomic ‘distance’ between any two organisms chosen at random from the sample,
taxonomic distinctness is the average path length between any two randomly chosen individuals conditional on them being from different species and
variation in taxonomic distinctness is the variance of the path length through the taxonomic tree connecting every pair of species in the list and
reflects the unevenness of the taxonomic tree.
